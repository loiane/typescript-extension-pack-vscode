This extension pack packages some of the most popular (and some I find very useful) Typescript extensions.

### Extensions included

* [TypeScript Hero](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rbbit.typescript-hero) - Favorite feature: sorts and organizes your imports according to convention and removes imports that are unused (`Ctrl+Alt+o` on Win/Linux or `Ctrl+Opt+o` on MacOS).

* [json2ts](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GregorBiswanger.json2ts) - Convert a JSON from clipboard to TypeScript interfaces. (Ctrl+Alt+V).

* [Move TS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stringham.move-ts) - this is a great extension to help you refactor and re-organize some files in the project. It automatically fixes the imports on the file that is being moved and also files that are importing the component you are moving. To use it: right-click on a file or folder in the Project Explorer pane and select 'Move TypeScript'.

* [Path Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense) - VSCode has a very good auto import capability, but sometime you still need to import some files manually, and this extension helps a lot in these cases.

* [TypeScript Importer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pmneo.tsimporter) - Automatically searches for TypeScript definitions in workspace files and provides all known symbols as completion item to allow code completion.

* [Prettier - JavaScript formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - format your Javascript / Typescript / CSS - I recommend adding the following config in you users setting for VsCode: 
  - Settings: `"prettier.singleQuote": true`

**Enjoy!**
